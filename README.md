This is a search application I'm creating, to search through json files of the students in the course.

To run flask on Windows:

set FLASK_APP=app

set FLASK_DEBUG=1

flask run

Once flask is running you can use your browser to visit your new web application on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
Ctr-C stops the program.
